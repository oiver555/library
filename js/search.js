The former, the one having the sea of glass before it, is (also according to John's view) in the most holy apartment of the heavenly sanctuary, for John saw before it  ”seven lamps of fire ” (Rev. 4:5) -- a sanctuary fixture.  ”As in vision the apostle John was granted a view of the temple of God in heaven he beheld there 'seven lamps of fire burning before the throne.'  ” -- The Great Controversy, p. 414.

      "Introduction The Need Of Investigation  ”God has precious light to come to His people.... When new light is presented to the church, it is perilous to shut yourself away from it.... To condemn that which you have not heard and do not understand will not exalt your wisdom in the eyes of those who are candid in their investigations of truth. And to speak with contempt of those whom God has sent with a message of truth is folly and madness....  ”...for God will glorify His Word, that it may appear in a light in which we have never before beheld it.... Light will come to every earnest seeker for truth, as it came to Nathanael.... There should be liberty given for a frank investigation of truth, that each may know for himself what is the truth.  ”...if a message comes that you do not understand, take pains that you may hear the reasons the messenger may give,...for your position will not be shaken by coming in contact with error.... No one of those who imagine that they know it all is too old or too intelligent to learn from the humblest of the messengers of the living God. ” -- Testimonies On Sabbath School Work, pp. 60-66.

      "foretold by the prophets, it is important for each to realize The Need Of Prophecy. Never in the annals of the Christian church has there been a shaking the like of that which is rapidly increasing as a result of the circulation of The Shepherd's Rod series of books and tracts throughout the rank and file of the Seventh-day Adventist denomination. It presents a singular and perplexing problem which human wisdom is utterly powerless to solve. In this extremity, then, we must turn to divine wisdom. Both the struggle and its remedy must be found in prophecy. Gladly, therefore, we accept the challenge:  ”Ask Me of things to come concerning My sons, and concerning the work of My hands command ye Me. ” Isa. 45:11. Only when the church finds herself grounded on a reef of her own folly, with the fierce waves of divine retribution beating over her sides, is she in a position to realize her dreadful danger and her need of everything. And only when thus endangered and alarmed can she possibly be roused to the absolute necessity of having the gift of prophecy -- her most imperative need in her present predicament.  ”Surely the Lord God will do nothing, but He revealeth His secret unto His servants the prophets. ” Amos 3:7.  ”Desire spiritual gifts, but rather that ye may prophesy.... He that prophesieth edifieth the church. ” 1 Cor. 14:1,4. ",

Therefore the spirit that instigated the killing of the ancient seers at the hand of the Jewish leaders, is today doing virtually the same sort of destructive work through organized religion.

Only if it reveals such a truth can we know that our interpretation is divinely inspired, not  ”private, ” and that it will stand every Bible test.

And them that had escaped from the sword carried he away to Babylon; where they were servants to him and his sons until the reign of the kingdom of Persia. ” 2 Chron. 36:17, 19, 20.",

But inasmuch as the Dark Ages, from 538 A.D. to 1798 A.D. (Dan. 7:25; Rev. 12:6, 14), divide the Holy Mountain of God into two separate parts, we are compelled to prove from another angle the time to which these two figurative  ”mountains of brass ” apply. Never has this symbolical prophecy been understood by any people; and never could it have been fulfilled and not been revealed (for then would its truth have been unavailable to the people in the past and but half efficacious to us now). Necessarily, then, its fulfillment is yet future, sometime in the latter part of the Christian era. The metal composing the  ”mountains ” must represent that which is to make up what they stand for. Explicitly, the  ”brass ” must disclose the people who are to make up two holy sections of the Christian church. In the second chapter of Daniel, four empires are symbolized by a great metallic image of gold, silver, brass, and iron -- a well understood prophecy of Babylon, Medo-Persia, Grecia, and Rome.",

      "Gold, being first of value in the order of metals, is singularly adapted in symbolizing the first empire after the flood. Silver, being second to gold, is the number two metal, and exactly symbolizes the second empire -- Medo-Persia. While brass, being third to gold, precisely fits the third empire (Grecia), and consequently has the numerical value of three. So, being of brass, the  ”mountains ” denote that the church which they symbolize is in period number three. And the fact that there is a third period, presupposes two preceding periods, making in all, three great divisions of time -- the first, from creation to the flood; the second, from the flood to the crucifixion of Christ; and the third, from the crucifixion to His second coming. The Christian era is therefore the one to which the symbolical  ”mountains of brass ” apply. Necessarily, then, the former of the two  ”mountains ” is symbolical of the spirit-filled early Christian church prior to 538 A.D., and the latter, of the Christian church sometime after 1798 A.D., when it is, as was the early Christian church, fitted for God's Holy Dwelling Place as described in the following scriptures:  ”O thou afflicted, tossed with tempest, and not comforted, behold, I...will make thy windows of agates, and thy gates of carbuncles...

And why so many tares choking up the wheat? Jesus says:  ”While men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat, and went his way. ” Matt. 13:25.

Throwing light on this condition, the Spirit of Prophecy says:  ”What greater deception can come upon human minds than a confidence that they are right, when they are all wrong! The message of the True Witness finds the people of God in a sad deception, yet honest in that deception... While those addressed are flattering themselves that they are in an exalted spiritual condition, the message of the True Witness breaks their security by the startling denunciation of their true condition of spiritual blindness poverty, and wretchedness.

This makes them the  ”first-fruits ” of the living who are to be translated, and  ”all their brethren ” whom they bring in (the  ”great multitude ” of Revelation 7, verse 9), the second fruits of the living who are to be translated: for where there are no second fruits, there can be no first. (For further light on this subject, read Tract No. 1, Pre- ”Eleventh Hour ” Extra!.) Brethren, we must  ”sigh and cry ” against the sins in the church; not against the message which is to seal us for translation and make us a people fitly symbolized by the mountains of brass. Your sighing and crying for the abominations done in her  ”midst, ” makes you eligible for the  ”mark ”; but should you attempt to shield the abominations, you shall fall under the slaughter weapons of the angels. The church is to be purified and made clean and fit to be God's Dwelling Place. In no other way can she be identified as the",

      "”mountain of brass, ” the symbol of endurance. This is the church that shall  ”enter upon her final conflict, ” and the one with whom the dragon is to be  ”wroth: ” for the symbolical  ”woman ” and  ”her seed, ” as a body, keep the commandments of God and have the  ”testimony of Jesus Christ. ” Rev. 12:17. Having fully cleared the first part of Zechariah's symbolism, we now give attention to The Valley Between The Mountains. The truth having been solidly established that the early Christian church is symbolized by one of the  ”brass mountains, ” and the church that closes the gospel work, by the other, then it follows as a logical sequence that the valley between, from which come the four chariots, must be symbolical of the period from the one church to the other. The next symbolism, then, to be considered is The Four Chariots. Says the prophet Zechariah:  ”In that day shall there be upon the bells of the horses, HOLINESS UNTO THE LORD. ” Zech. 14:20. As symbols to illustrate various lessons, horses are quite prominently employed in the Scriptures, being in every instance perfectly adapted, of course, to the circumstance or situation. In this connection, they represent people, for the sounding of their  ”bells ” is  ”HOLINESS",

      "UNTO THE LORD; ” whereas  ”the spasmodic fitful movements of some who claim to be Christians is well represented by the work of strong but untrained horses. When one pulls forward, another pulls back. ” -- Testimonies to Ministers, pp. 489, 490. These symbolical  ”horses, ” therefore, each portray a certain class of people in connection with the church. And owing to the fact that each team is leading a chariot, they can denote only a class of church leaders. The chariots, consequently, must in some way depict the church membership which the symbolical horses are leading. Moreover, to Zechariah's question,  ”What are these, my lord?...the angel answered and said,...These are the four spirits of the heavens, which go forth from standing before the Lord of all the earth. ” Zech. 6:4, 5. Hence these symbolisms stand for heaven-born messages carried by the church on earth. And since the symbolism is self-defining, it answers the question: Why Chariot a Symbol of a Church? The Scriptures symbolize God's church by various earthly objects. To illustrate:  ”In that day, ” says the Lord,  ”will I make Jerusalem a burdensome stone for all people: all that burden themselves with it shall be cut in pieces. ” Zech. 12:3.  ”Thou shalt also be a crown of glory in the hand of the Lord. ” Isa. 62:3.  ”And",

      "the seven candlesticks which thou sawest are the seven churches. ” Rev. 1:20. The same object cannot perfectly characterize the church under varying conditions and circumstances or relationships. For example, on the one hand the church that gave birth to Christ (Rev. 12:1, 2) cannot congruously be symbolized by a chariot, but rather only by a woman, while on the other hand the church with which God will break the nations, cannot congruously be likened to a woman, but rather to a  ”stone ” (Dan. 2:45), or an  ”axe. ” Jer. 51:20. For a church in its work of gathering souls, the most fitting symbol is a  ”chariot, ” and for its leadership, naturally  ”horses. ” As there are, in the symbolization before us, four chariots to be identified, we must therefore consider each one separately, beginning with The First Chariot. The consecutive order of the chariots indicates a series of gospel events.  ”In the first chariot were red horses. ” That the color red stands for bloodshed, the Spirit of Prophecy bears out:  ”As we were traveling along, we met a company.... I noticed red as a border on their garments.... I asked Jesus who they were. He said they were martyrs that had been slain for Him. ” -- Early Writings, pp. 18,19.

In response to Zechariah's question as to who the horses were and where they were going, the angel answered:  ”The black horses which are therein go forth into the north country; and the white go forth after them; and the grisled go forth toward the south country. And the bay went forth, and sought to go that they might walk to and fro through the earth. ” Zech. 6:6, 7. Though the angel's answer discloses the respective directions toward which the black, white, grisled, and bay horses went, it omits to make the slightest mention of the red horses, thus riveting the conclusion that the red horses were martyred and went nowhere so far as their final destination is concerned. This being clear our next step, logically, is to identify The Second Chariot.  ”And in the second chariot [were] black horses. ” Universally, the figurative significance of  ”black ” is bondage. So as the martyrdom of the early Christian church was followed by the Dark Ages of religion, from 538 A.D. to 1798 A.D., it is very evident that the chariot with the black horses represents the church and its leadership during this long prophetic period in Ecclesiastical Roman bondage.

Again: when the Jews were returning from Babylon to Jerusalem, God spoke through His prophet Zechariah, saying:  ”Ho, ho, come forth, and flee from the land of the north ” (Zech. 2:6), thus identifying Babylon as  ”the north country. ” But as we are dealing with the fulfillment of prophecy in the New Testament era, the north country in this connection must be antitypical Babylon -- Christianized Rome -- where God's people during the New Testament period have gone. This clear-cut truth concerning the second chariot, leads us to the exposition of The Third Chariot. And there were  ”in the third chariot white horses. ” Since black is significant of bondage, then white, being the opposite of black, must denote liberty. Accordingly, the white horses with their chariot must be symbolical of the church, following her 1260 year period of Roman bondage. Said the angel to Zechariah:  ”The white go forth after ” the black horses, to the north country. The white chariot therefore represents",

Just as the name  ”Philadelphia ” fits only one church organization, and only one of the chariots, so the name  ”Laodiceans ” can logically fit only one of the chariots and only one denomination. The word, itself, is derived from the Greek word, Lego-dikean, meaning,  ”declaring judgment. ” After the event of the Philadelphian church, there must therefore be a church declaring judgment. And it is a historical fact that in 1844 A.D., the very year the Millerite movement came to the end of its appointed course, a new movement, the Seventh-day Adventist denomination, arose, proclaiming:  ”Fear God, and give glory to Him; for the hour of His judgment is come. ” Rev. 14:7. In spite of the unenviable record of the Laodicean church, the founder of its movement, unlike the founders of other movements, honestly states in Testimonies, Vol. 3, p. 252:  ”The message to the church of the Laodiceans is a startling denunciation, and is applicable to the people of God at the present time ” -- the Seventh-day Adventists.

O, Brother, Sister, be not fooled: if this does not reach your heart now in time to save you from the evil to come, it will surely overtake you eventually, but then only to destroy, not to save, you. So stay no longer with the grisled horses in Egypt, for to do so will be only to perish there with them while The Bay Take The Chariot To The Promised Land. Seeing that the chariot is drawn by both teams each pulling in a different direction from the other, obviously both cannot win out without breaking it in two, thus leaving it ruined and useless. One pair or the other, therefore, must be cut out of the traces. And the fact that the bay (the  ”strong horses ” Zech. 6:3, margin) are the ones who  ”walk to and fro through the earth ” while the grisled remain in Egypt, shows that the bay alone are to possess the chariot and to take it from Egypt to the promised land. Although this remarkable prophetic symbolization, now opened up fully, was simply another locked prophecy when The Shepherd's Rod, Vol.1 was published and sent throughout the S.D.A. denomination in 1930, yet in its momentous message to Laodicea (declaring that the prophecy of the ninth chapter of Ezekiel is on the verge of fulfillment, and that those who escape the  ”slaughter ” will comprise the future leadership of the church), the warning-tragedy",

Thus we see that from the very first, The Shepherd's Rod, in projecting a preview of the same critical problem encountered in the warning-paradox here revealed, was published in pre-clarification of Zechariah's prophecy! And, reciprocally, not only does this remarkable prediction make the Word of God appear more marvelous than ever before, but also it sustains the message in The Shepherd's Rod, and unveils the outcome of the baffling difficulty before us, the like of which has never occurred in the history of the church. Though the leaders of the S.D.A. denomination are determined to drive out of the church all who believe in the message of The Shepherd's Rod, they are trying to make it appear that the Rod's adherents are pulling out for themselves. The paradoxical truth, however, shows that they are to posses  ”the chariot, ” and their refusing to leave the church demonstrates in actuality the certainty of the bay horses' alone taking the chariot to its destination --  ”to and fro through the earth. ” The revelation of this warning-paradox also demonstrates that God controls the Scriptures and brings them to light at just the very time His people need to know which way to turn!

Though ye have lien among the pots, yet shall ye be as the wings of a dove covered with silver, and her feathers with yellow gold. ” Ps. 68:12,13. So whereas the bay horses are now getting themselves groomed to go  ”to and fro through the earth, ” the grisled are endeavoring to kick the bay away from the chariot and to keep it in The South Country. To determine the antitypical significance of the  ”south country, ” we consult the Revelation:  ”And I will give power unto My two Witnesses, and They shall prophesy a thousand two hundred and threescore days, clothed in sackcloth. And when They shall have finished Their testimony, the beast that ascendeth out of the bottomless pit shall make war against Them, and shall overcome Them and kill Them.

Since, therefore, the atheistic French government in 1793 is called by the Scriptures  ”Sodom and Egypt, where also our Lord was crucified, ” ancient Egypt --  ”the south country ” -- is symbolical of our present world in general, where  ”our Lord was crucified. ” Consequently, though  ”the black ” and  ”the white horses ” went  ”into the north country ” (Christendom),  ”the grisled horses ” went toward  ”the south country ” (the world). In remarkable corroboration of this particular phase of the prophecy, the Seventh-day Adventist denomination, after the disappointment in 1844, went forth in fulfillment of the following divine commission:  ”Thou must prophesy again before many peoples, and nations, and tongues, and kings. ” Rev. 10:11. Thus does  ”the more sure word of prophecy, ” borne out in detail by church history, establish the fact that the message of the S.D.A. denomination has gone to the world -- Egypt.

Make haste Brother, Sister; immediately take your stand on the Lord's side, so that He may, because of your  ”sighing ” (repenting) and  ”crying ” (proclaiming the sealing message), without delay disclose  ”to view ” as the  ”servants of our God, ” you who shall escape being among the  ”slain of the Lord, ” be sent unto the Gentiles, and  ”bring all your brethren...out of all nations. ” Isa. 66:16, 19, 20.

      "INTRODUCTION Though it is the crowning work of our salvation and of the setting up of the kingdom of Christ upon earth, yet the   ”investigative judgment  ” is one of the least understood and most mystified and confused Bible subjects of the age. Were it not essential to our salvation, the enemy would not have expended every possible effort to envelop it in darkness. Imperative, then, is the unremitting need to search the Scriptures   ”as for hidden treasure,  ” and to beseech God for the guidance of His Spirit in order rightly to understand this all-important subject. In vain though, any search for truth unless the motive be to learn and to do the will of God. Hence,   ”if any man,  ” says Jesus,   ”will do His will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God.  ” John 7:17. Since the subject of the judgment is taught in types and in parables, and since the Lord explains that His teaching parabolically is so that only His disciples may know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven (Matt. 13:11), obviously, therefore, None But His Followers Can Understand The Whole Truth.   ”The kingdom of heaven,  ” He says,   ”is like unto treasure hid in a field; the which when a man hath found, he hideth, and for joy thereof goeth and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that field.

      "kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man, seeking goodly pearls: who, when he had found one pearl of great price, went and sold all that he had, and bought it.  ” Matt. 13:44-46. In these parables, Christ clearly sets forth present truth as the indispensable condition to the establishing of His kingdom, and supreme effort as the indispensable condition to entering into it. Thus   ”none,  ” declares the Spirit of Prophecy,   ”but those who have fortified the mind with the truths of the Bible will stand through the last great conflict. To every soul will come the searching test, Shall I obey God rather than men? The decisive hour is even now at hand. Are our feet planted on the rock of God's immutable Word?  ” -- The Great Controversy, pp. 593, 594. Let us come out of the stupor of presuming on God's grace, yet regarding Him responsible for any consequent issue of our life. He has perfectly done His part in fully charting the narrow path to the kingdom; now let us do our honest best to follow therein to the end of the way, for the joy that awaits us there! But never shall we do so save in returning to the old landmarks by forsaking the Devil, who has turned God's people from   ”the Way, the Truth, and the life  ” (John 14:6), into   ”a way which seemeth right unto a man,  ” but the end of which   ”are the ways of death.  ” Prov. 14:12.",

      "THE JUDGMENT AND THE HARVEST IN TESTIMONY, PARABLE, AND CEREMONY --------------------------- In the Light of the Testimonies of the Prophets Since by some the position is stoutly maintained that this all-important truth cannot be established by the Scriptures alone, let the reader therefore give attention to what the Bible says   ”I beheld till the thrones were cast down, and the Ancient of days did sit, Whose garment was white as snow, and the hair of His head like the pure wool: His throne was like the fiery flame and His wheels as burning fire. A fiery stream issued and came forth from before Him: thousand thousands ministered unto Him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before Him the judgment was set, and the books were opened.  ” Dan. 7:9, 10. In this scripture are set forth four pertinent facts: (1) the thrones were not present prior to the opening of the scene envisioned; (2) the Ancient of days came and did sit when the thrones were set up; (3) then the books were opened; (4) all of",

      "which (thrones, Ancient of days, and books) reveal a judgment scene. And since the books are obviously the focal point in the scene, the question naturally arises, What Is The Reason For Books? Fundamental to a correct concept of the judgment, is a correct understanding of the nature of it and of the reason for the books. As to the latter John the Revelator says:   ”And I saw the dead, small and great stand be fore God; and the books were opened: and another book was opened, which is the Book of Life: and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books.  ” Rev 20:12. Unquestionably, therefore, the books contain both the names and the records of all who are to be judged. And naturally these names and record were entered while each person was living   ”Thine eyes,  ” says the Psalmist,   ”did see my substance, yet being unperfect; and in Thy book all my members were written, which in continuance were fashioned, when as yet there was none of them.  ” Ps. 139:16.   ”The Lord shall count, when He writeth up the people, that this man was born there.  ” Ps. 87:6.

      "Reason For The Judgment. That not every name that has been entered in the Lamb's books will be retained there, is born out with sad conclusiveness by the following scriptures:   ”And the Lord said unto Moses, Whosoever hath sinned against Me, him will I blot out of My book.  ” Ex. 32:33.   ”And if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the Book of Life, and out of the holy city, and from the things which are written in this book.  ” Rev. 22:19. Accordingly, the books contain the names of a mixed multitude, -- both those who stood firmly in the faith and continued patiently to the end, and those who did not. Said Christ:   ”He that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved.  ” Matt. 24:13. But those who do not endure shall be lost.   ”And these are they likewise which are sown on stony ground; who, when they have heard the Word, immediately receive it with gladness; and have no root in themselves, and so endure but for a time: afterward, when affliction or persecution ariseth for the Word's sake, immediately they are offended.  ” Mark 4:16,17.   ”O Lord, the hope of Israel, all that forsake Thee shall be ashamed, and they that depart from Me shall be written in the",

      "earth, because they have forsaken the Lord, the fountain of living waters.  ” Jer. 17:13. So, there must come a day of reckoning, a day when the names of those who are found unworthy of eternal life will be blotted out of the Lamb's Book of Life -- a proceeding for which the only correct term can be,   ”investigative judgment.  ” And now that the   ”time is come that judgment must begin at the house of God...,  ”   ”thou therefore endure hardness, as a good soldier of Jesus Christ  ” (2 Tim. 2:3), for   ”if it [the judgment] first begin at us, what shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel of God?  ” 1 Pet. 4:17. Since, therefore, in the fullness of time, the judgment will begin in the house of God, the church, each one is confronted with the imperative need to know How Names Are Retained In The Book. At the moment we accept Christ as our personal Saviour through the Word of Truth, -- at that supreme moment God forgives us our sins, and the hands bloodstained by Calvary inscribe our names in the Lamb's Book of Life. Then simultaneously the pen of angels begins in the heavenly ledger the life or death chronicle of our Christian experience separate from our past. Even   ”the very hairs of your head are all numbered.  ” Matt. 10:30. Therefore   ”suffer not thy mouth to cause thy flesh to sin; neither say thou before",

For in the investigative judgment the books are opened and the deeds done in the flesh are brought to light for a final reckoning before the Ancient of days. All who have stood fast to the end will then forever have their sins blotted from the books and their names retained therein; while all who are not overcomers will then forever have their sins retained in the books and their names blotted therefrom. Always man's greatest test, and one which has ever involved almost an instantaneous decision, has been in the unrolling of the scroll -- in the eclipse of a past message by a new one, -- present truth. On every such occasion each one has had to decide: Shall I heed the new and unpopular truth and walk in its light, joining with those who are despised by nearly every religious leader in the land? or shall I allow myself to be deterred by the decision and counsel of the ministry in my church? When the judgment begins and the books open and the cases of each generation pass in succession in review before the judicial tribunal, some generations suffer an almost wholesale blotting out of names instead of sins. When the generation of Christ's first advent is weighed in the balance of the sanctuary, a whole nation will be found wanting and their names will be wiped from the book.

While on the other hand he who accepts the truth but fails faithfully to live and to proclaim it, thereby brings upon himself ruin also -- that against which Ezekiel warns:   ”When a righteous man doth turn from his righteousness, and commit iniquity, and I lay a stumblingblock [a message] before him, he shall die: because thou hast not given him warning, he shall die in his sin, and his righteousness which he hath done shall not be remembered; but his blood will I require at thine hand.

Because of their erroneous belief that God's throne has always been in the sanctuary and that Christ after ascending on high sat there at the right hand of His Father, men have put forth every effort possible to prove that Christ entered   ”within the veil  ” immediately after He left His disciples. But as all such efforts, albeit ever so well-meaning in the interest of truth, are put forth by minds inspired, not by the Spirit of Truth, but rather by preconception, we must therefore diligently entreat the Lord for the promised Comforter to lead us into all truth, and to save us from being presumptuous and from blindly taking things for granted and forming conclusions without digging beneath the surface.   ”We have also a more sure word of prophecy   ” says the apostle Peter;   ”whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts: knowing this first, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation.

      "The wise reader, therefore, will henceforth cease giving place to human theories and speculations which tempt him to the uttermost to make flesh his arm. He will instead attend diligently to Bible prophecy and to inspired interpretations and will learn therefrom that the sanctuary is God's Temporary Throne Room. Since earthly beings, themselves having never been in heaven, are naturally strangers to heaven's realities (1 Cor. 2:9), then in order for God to make heavenly truth known unto them, He must reveal it by means of earthly realities with which they are familiar. Hence through the sanctuary work on earth is seen the sanctuary work in heaven (Heb. 9:1-9). Indeed, the sanctuary above being the pattern of the one below the services of the former are therefore definitely revealed in the services of the latter. And the fact that the earthly sanctuary was appointed as a place for confession and for forgiveness of sins, shows that the throne-room in the heavenly sanctuary is only temporary. From it, while sin exists, the Lord carries on the work of removing from the universe sin and sinners. And this light in turn clearly shows that not until after sin came into the universe could the sanctuary congruously have existed in heaven.   ”I looked,  ” exclaimed the Revelator about 96 A.D., upon being shown the throne in the sanctuary,   ”and behold, a",

On the one hand, before the throne are the   ”seven lamps burning  ” and the   ”Lamb as it had been slain,  ” showing that the throne was   ”set  ” there to serve in time of probation. The light from the candlestick represents the light of truth in the church while the blood of the Lamb is atoning for sinful beings. On the other hand, upon the throne sits the Ancient of days, the Judge, surrounded by the jury of twenty-four elders plus the angelic witnesses,   ”ten thousand times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands  ” of them, plus the four beasts (who, being   ”redeemed  ”   ”out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation  ” -- Rev. 5:8, 9, -- are therefore symbolical of the saints,-- all those whose sins will be blotted from the books of records, -- just as the beasts of Daniel 7 are symbolical of all the kingdoms which will perish in their sins), with the Lamb, our Advocate, in the midst. All this shows a combined mediatorial-judicial work.

In addition to this, we shall now see from Daniel's prophecy that the judgment throne was set up in the Most Holy apartment of the heavenly sanctuary after the   ”little horn  ” of Daniel 7 came up.   ”I considered the horns,  ” says the seer,   ”and, behold, there came up among them another little horn, before whom there were three of the first homs plucked up by the roots: and, behold, in this horn were eyes like the eyes of man, and a mouth speaking great things.

Because the sanctuary throne was not in existence in the days of the early Christian church, therefore the throne upon which Stephen saw Christ at the   ”right hand of God  ” (Acts 7:56) could not have been in the sanctuary, wherein is the   ”sea of glass,  ” but rather in Paradise, whence flows the   ”river of water of life,  ” and on either side of which is   ”the tree of life.  ” Rev. 22:1, 2.

Hence, His mediatorial work began First In The Holy, Then In The Most Holy. In the earthly sanctuary the high priest (typifying Christ) officiated first in the holy apartment throughout the year, then upon the day of Atonement, the day of cleansing the sanctuary and judging the people, he officiated in the Most Holy for one day only. This twofold service signifies that in the heavenly sanctuary, the High priest, Christ, must necessarily first officiate in the holy apartment up to the antitypical day of Atonement, then during that day, He must officiate in the Most Holy apartment, before the throne. Thus the earthly services, too, repudiate the idea that Christ entered the Most Holy apartment of the heavenly sanctuary immediately after His ascension. Very plainly, then, the ceremonial system reveals that from the time Christ   ”sat on the right hand of God  ” (Mark 16:19), where the   ”river of water of life  ” is, to the time that He and the Father moved to the throne in the sanctuary, where   ”the sea of glass  ” is (Dan. 7:9, 10; Rev. 4.6), He",

From the foregoing facts, clear and distinct, the only tenable conclusion to be drawn is that Christ, immediately after His ascension, rather that entering within the veil in the sanctuary, sat down at the right hand of His Father, in Paradise and from there carried on His work in the holy apartment of the sanctuary. How clear, already, the light of truth at last shining forth on this all-important subject of salvation so long shrouded in the dense fog of human theories and speculations! And how solid the resultant vindication of the Spirit of Prophecy's reaffirmation of its position on the subject:   ”that the sanctuary question stands in righteousness and truth, just as we have held it for so many years.  ” -- Gospel Workers, p. 303.   ”Cast not away therefore your confidence which hath great recompense of reward.

Plainly, therefore, the judgment is to begin and the sanctuary to be cleansed, not before, but after the fulfillment of the period for those appointed to die. The judging being consistent with the records found in the books of heaven, the names, therefore, of those who are found unworthy, without the   ”wedding garment  ” on, are blotted from the books. Thus is the sanctuary cleansed. Speaking of the commencement of this work of judging and cleansing, the angel said unto Daniel:   ”Unto two thousand and three hundred days; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed.  ” Dan. 8:14. Since the cleansing, accordingly takes place at the termination of the 2,300 days and since it is, as we have seen, the judgment,",

Nevertheless, even these renderings as they stand, lend such feeble plausibility to the theories held in opposition to the doctrine that the 2,300 days terminate in the end of the world, as to compel the theorizers to read into Daniel 8:14 the word   ”sacrifice  ” so as to transform the   ”evening morning  ” phase of the text to read   ”evening morning sacrifices.  ” Next, on the grounds that there were two sacrifices a day, they split the number of them in half. And the number being 2,400, 2,200, or 2,300, depending on which version they use, they get respectively 1,200, 1,100, 1,150 days!

The discrepancy between the two figures is due to the difference in the dates necessary to work out the different ideas on the text.

Being merely a historian, though, and not a prophet, he accordingly, in writing the history of the Jews, made only a historical application of the similarity which he saw between Daniel's prediction and Antiochus' work.

And, finally, the very fact that the sanctuary in Jerusalem was neither polluted nor cleansed in the manner described by the angel, but was left desolate and was ultimately destroyed (Dan. 9:26), puts the riveting evidence to the proof that neither the polluting nor the cleansing took place in the Old Testament era.

As furthermore, the commandment to rebuild Jerusalem went forth in 457 B.C. (Ezra 7:21- 27), the starting point of the seventy weeks proves to be one with that of the 2300 days.

Rejoice ye in that day, and leap for joy: for, behold, your reward is great in heaven: for in the like manner did their fathers unto the prophets.  ” Luke 6:22, 23. As the period since the passing of the apostles has been the wheat and tare-growing time, and as, moreover, the Laodicean church is the last of the seven sections of the Christian church in which are commingled the wheat and the tares we must learn the answer to the question:",

      "Which Is The Laodicean Church? Laodicea may be infallibly recognized amidst the many   ”isms  ” of Christendom by the work she is doing -- declaring the judgment. Indeed, this mark of identification is pointed out by the very name Laodicea, compounded of the two Greek words lao and dekei, the one meaning   ”people,  ” also   ”speak,  ” the other meaning   ”judgment,  ” the two in one meaning the people declaring judgment. The church therefore, which declares,   ”Fear God, and give glory to Him; for the hour of His judgment is come  ” (Rev. 14:7), is evidently the one called Laodicea. And it is almost as well known outside Seventh-day Adventist circles as within, that the Seventh-day Adventist church is endeavoring to carry the judgment message of Revelation 14:7, and is therefore unchallenged in her claim to the title, Laodicea. Plainly, then, the names of   ”the seven churches  ” (representing the successive sections of the Christian church, of which the Laodicean is the last) are not   ”just names.  ” Take as another example the name of the sixth,   ”Philadelphia.  ” Its meaning,   ”brotherly love,  ” being a misnomer of the spiritual condition of any other church organization in the entire Christian era, implicitly fits, however, the state of charity common and singular to the sixth -- the Millerite church.",

And as the former are delivered while the latter fall under the slaughter weapons of the angels, there is clearly seen a complete separation of the tares from among the wheat in the Time Of Harvest. Though the true meaning and time of the harvest is greatly confused by some and confusing to many, a close study of the Word will clear it in just as simple manner as it cleared both the time of the seed-sowing and the period of the wheat and the tares. With His eye piercing the mists of the ages, Christ foresaw the negligence of His watchmen and the evil which was to spring up in His church. Nevertheless, after being asked by His servants,   ”Didst not Thou sow good seed in Thy field? from whence then hath it tares?...Wilt Thou then that we go and gather them up?...He said, Nay; lest while ye gather up the tares, ye root up also the wheat with them. Let both grow together until the harvest: and in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather ye together first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them: but gather the wheat into My barn.  ” Matt. 13:27-30.

And though harvest time is the shortest of all the periods of the harvest year, the work of reaping is not done in a moment; it takes time. The yield is not garnered by turning the field right into the barn; no, that would be a conglomerate mass instead of a harvest. First the sickle is put to the grain, and next the grain is bound into sheaves, then threshed, after which it is put into the barn; and thereafter the chaff and the tares are destroyed. This work being completed during the autumn, it shows that the harvest is a season of time after   ”the summer is past,  ” and that it is followed by the fruitless winter period. So it must be with the spiritual harvest which otherwise could not be illustrated by the literal. Do not regard lightly the wisdom of God: His illustrations are perfect. Consider, now, with what exact fidelity to the natural harvest the Master has stated the truths of the spiritual harvest:   ”Let both grow together until the harvest,  ” He says:   ”and in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather ye together first the tares and bind them in bundles to burn them: but gather the wheat into My barn.  ” Matt. 13:30.

Be admonished, therefore, not to let vain imaginings come into the mind, but stand squarely on the Scriptures, for they are full of meaning of illimitable value -- are, indeed, your very life. As the word   ”until  ” means   ”up to,  ” the tares are therefore to be gathered out, not before or after the harvest, but at the beginning of it. And   ”the time of harvest  ” being   ”the end of probationary time  ” (Christ's Object Lessons, p. 72), then the harvesting itself necessarily precedes the close of probation -- the fruitless winter season. Consequently, the tares are separated from among the wheat before, not after, the end of probationary time. The wheat,   ”the children of the kingdom  ” (Matt. 13:38), are gathered into the barn, the kingdom; the tares,   ”the children of the wicked one  ” (verse 38) -- mere professors, those who are not doers of the Word, and who were granted membership   ”while men slept  ” --   ”are gathered and burned in the fire  ” (Matt. 13:40), after the wheat is bound into sheaves.

Indeed, the third angel   ”is to select the wheat from the tares and seal, or bind, the wheat for the heavenly garner.  ” -- Early Writings, p. 118. Therefore the angels, the reapers, whom Christ sends forth, include both him who does the sealing, or binding, and those who follow on to do the destroying (Ezek. 9:2, 5 6), first in the church, then in the world. Thus is the Separation In Two Sections. The command,   ”Gather out of His kingdom all things that offend, and them which do iniquity,  ” does not mean to gather His saints from the earth into heaven; neither does it mean to destroy the wicked from the earth; for the former are to be gathered, not directly to heaven, but first into   ”the barn,  ” the kingdom on earth; and the latter are not to be destroyed immediately   ”in the time of harvest,  ” but first are to be gathered into bundles, and then destroyed, as is further illustrated in the parable of the net:   ”Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net, that was cast into the sea, and gathered of every kind: which, when it was full, they drew to shore, and sat down, and gathered the good into vessels, but cast the bad away.  ” Matt. 13:47, 48.",

      "This parable also shows the separation of the wicked from among God's people in the church (  ”the net  ”), this being the first section of the work of separation, the beginning of the harvest. The subsequent section follows in the world, as the earth is lightened with the glory of the   ”Loud Cry  ” angel, and as   ”another voice from heaven,  ” says:   ”Come out of her, My people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues.  ” Rev. 18:4. Note that in the first section of the separation the one in the church, the wicked are taken away from among the just, whereas in the second, the one in Babylon, the just are called from among the wicked. As the field is   ”the world  ” (Matt. 13:38), the parable of the wheat and the tares necessarily comprehends both sections of the harvest. As, by contrast, the   ”net  ” hauls in the   ”fish,  ” the converts made by the gospel church, the parable of the net therefore is limited to the separation in the church.

And since, furthermore, these escaped ones are to bring all their brethren   ”to My holy mountain Jerusalem, saith the Lord,  ”   ”in a clean vessel into the house of the Lord  ” (Isa. 66:20, last part), the fact is fully evident that the destruction of the wicked results in the purification of the church. The   ”clean vessel  ” is therefore the purified church, composed of the escaped ones the first fruits, the 144,000 -- who, free from the wicked (the tares) shall then, as   ”the servants of our God,  ” bring in the second fruits, the great multitude which no man can number, out of all nations.

      "This being the dreadful experience of the tares in Babylon, in the second section of the harvest, there must, as a type, be a similar and precedent experience for the tares in the Laodicean church, in the first section of the harvest, a parallel which shows conclusively that The Church Is Not Babylon. The reason that the church is figuratively not   ”Babylon  ” is that it is called Jerusalem (Ezek. 9:4,8), and from among the good therein, the wicked (the tares) are destroyed, taken out, by the six men with the slaughter weapons (Ezek. 9:6-9), and then afterward the good (the wheat) are gathered in   ”the barn;  ” while from among the wicked in Babylon, the just (  ”My people  ”) are called out and gathered into the barn, and then the seven angels pour out the seven last plagues, and the remaining wicked are destroyed. Thus in the first section of the harvest, the separation in the church, the wicked are destroyed by six men with slaughter weapons, before the good are taken out; and in the second section, the separation among the churches in Babylon, the wicked are destroyed by seven angels with the seven last plagues, after the good are taken out.

Consequently, the day of atonement was a day of judgment, as it is still commonly called by the Jews, and by that token it was founded as the type of the great antitypical day of atonement (the investigative judgment) -- the day in which the Lord will blot from His book the names of all sinners, and   ”cut off  ” from the congregation of His people all whose names are not in the book. Concerning the typical day of atonement, the Lord's command through Moses was:   ”On that day shall the priest make an atonement for you, to cleanse you, that you may be clean from all your sins before the Lord....and he shall make an atonement for the holy sanctuary, and he shall make an atonement for the tabernacle of the con- gregation, and for the altar.  ” Lev. 16:30, 33.

One was dedicated at the beginning of the harvest; the other at the completion of it.

For more than a thousand years the annual waving of the sheaf pointed forward to its antitypical event, the resurrection of Christ. And as Christ arose on the very day that the wave-sheaf was to be offered, the day   ”after the Sabbath,  ” let no one attribute the singular concurrence of these two events on that day to mere coincidence or to any cause other than divine design.   ”He was the antitype of the wave-sheaf,  ” declares the Spirit of Prophecy,   ”and His resurrection took place on the very day when the wave-sheaf was to be presented before the Lord.  ” -- Desire of Ages, p. 785 .

The apostolic Pentecost was accordingly the prototype of the ceremonial Pentecost (the day the wave-loaves were offered). And since the wave-sheaf was a figure of Christ and of those who arose with Him as the first of the first fruits of the dead, hence the wave-loaves were a figure on the 120 Spirit-filled disciples who were the full complement of first fruits of the dead, and who were gathered in after the resurrection. From these facts it can more clearly be seen that those whom Christ took with Him were the living wave-sheaf and the only one that has been offered in the heavenly sanctuary; and that as ones raised from the dead, they are the first fruits of the dead, whereas as ones everliving before the Father, they are the living wave-sheaf of the first fruits of the living, the 144,000 servants of God, who sequentially precede The Second Fruits And The Feast Of Tabernacles.

And as in the type the feast was to be celebrated at the close of the final ingathering of the year's harvest, then correspondingly in the antitype it must be celebrated at the close of the final ingathering of earth's harvest, which is nearing its fulfillment. So the time consumed in producing and in offering the wave-sheaf and the wave-loaves, also in observing the Feast of Tabernacles, is representative of the entire spiritual harvest time of the living and of the dead.

At that time the wicked will all be destroyed.  ” -- Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 541. Plainly, therefore, since the first and the second fruits of the literal harvest and its attendant rites foreshadowed a spiritual harvest of first and second fruits, they are to be climaxed by the antitypical Feast of Tabernacles.   ”I saw the saints,  ” says the servant of the Lord in describing this celebration,   ”leaving the cities and villages, and associating together in companies, and living in the most solitary places.

Irrefutably, therefore, the harvest of Matthew 13 precedes the close of probation, and is the time of the ingathering of the first and second fruits -- the 144,000 and the   ”great multitude,  ” -- all the saints who are to be translated.

In other words, those who died prior to the final Pentecost are to be judged by the light of truth reflected through the power of the apostolic Pentecost. (From His baptism to His ascension, Christ taught abroad the truth which was to prepare those who accepted it, to impart it. Then on the day of Pentecost, He endued them with His Spirit to proclaim it with power.) Concerning the judgment, the harvest, the servant of the Lord declares:   ”I then saw the third angel.

Their resurrection from the dead signified the beginning of the first-fruit harvest of the 120 disciples who were to die and be resurrected. The fact that the followers of Christ were not of one accord before the resurrection, is very positive testimony that the first fruits (the 120) of them that sleep did not ripen (become fully converted) until after the resurrection.

The 120 who received the power of the Spirit on the very day the wave-loaves were offered, were therefore the antitypical wave-loaves, signifying the completeness of the first-fruit harvest. Subsequently came the second fruits of the dead, in the period of which the tares were commingled with the wheat. Wonderful indeed is the way in which God has worked out the plan of salvation and revealed it step by step as necessary. When in 1844 the investigative judgment of the dead and the ingathering of the first fruits of the living began, He did not leave His people in darkness concerning these events. The very first vision which Sister White received in 1844 was of the 144,000 first fruits, the   ”servants of our God,  ” who shall never taste death. (See Early Writings, pp. 13-15.) Just as Christ and those whom He raised and took with Him became the prototypical sheaf, betokening the ingathering of the first fruits (the 120) of those who are to be resurrected, so also when He entered upon His priestly ministration in the first apartment of the heavenly sanctuary, and presented Himself and His trophies before His Father, they became the antitypical sheaf, betokening the ingathering",

In the light of this parallel, the spiritual condition of the 120 before the apostolic Pentecost is clearly seen to typify the spiritual condition of the 144,000 before the future Pentecost. The 40 days (Acts 1:3, 9) from the resurrection to the ascension are consequently typical of the period from 1844 to the fulfillment of the marking and slaying as recorded in Ezekiel 9 and Revelation 7:3-8; 14:1-5 respectively, and in Testimonies to Ministers, p. 445, Testimonies, Vol. 3, p. 266, also Early Writings, pp. 270-273.

Perhaps foremost among the multitudes who are snared while doing all they can to run away from inspired interpretation of the Scriptures are the extremists, of whom there are at least two classes: one with the tendency to literalize, the other with the tendency to spiritualize. Take for example the Revelator's statement:   ”...I saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the Word of God,...and they cried with a loud voice, saying, How long, O Lord, holy and true, dost Thou not judge and avenge our blood?  ” Rev. 6:9, 10. The literalist on the one hand, would interpret this scripture to mean that the souls were conscious and actually crying out, though the Bible is very explicit that   ”the dead know not anything.  ” Eccles. 9:5. And, too, were the souls under the altar literally crying out for vengeance on their murderers, then, to be consistent, the Lord's statement,   ”the voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto Me from the ground  ” (Gen. 4:10), also the statement,   ”all the trees of the field shall clap their hands  ” (Isa. 55:12), likewise must be interpreted literally in spite of the fact that it is impossible physically for blood to cry out and for trees to clap hands.

He ought easily, too, to perceive that the souls of the martyrs crying for vengeance on their murderers, and that the blood of Abel crying for vengeance on his murderer, are cases virtually identical in circumstance and condition. Both of these find pointed illustration in the poetic utterance:   ”I hear a voice crying out, the voice of the withering field: O, Lord, pity Thou me. Let showers fall from heaven. Quench Thou my burning soul.  ” For one's soul to be imprisoned consciously under something for hundreds of years, with nothing to do but groaningly to languish in waiting for the resurrection morning, the while crying out for vengeance on them that spilled one's blood, -- what an inexpressibly unbearable state for one's soul to be in! The doctrine, though, of the unconscious state of the dead not only puts at peace the worried human mind but also ascribes to God mercy and love toward helpless human beings, thus being the only position on the subject that can lead the sinner rationally to love God and to trust in Him.

But Peter insists that to construe Paul's use of the term   ”holy place  ” to mean the   ”Holiest of all,  ” is both unreasonable and unfair, for no writer in clear mind, speaking of both apartments, will indiscriminately interchange the terms, and yet expect his readers accurately to comprehend the idea he is putting forth.

In reply to this, Peter protests that Moses does so because whereas he calls the second apartment   ”the holy place within the vail,  ” he calls the first apartment   ”the tabernacle of the congregation  ” (Lev. 16:16), while Paul chooses to term the first apartment   ”the holy place,  ” and the second apartment,   ”the Holiest of all.  ” Again: Peter insists that if, in Paul's writings, where both apartments are discussed, one is justified in interpreting   ”the holy  ” to mean   ”Holiest of all,  ” then another, by the same token of logic, is equally justified in interpreting the   ”Holiest of all  ” to mean the   ”holy.  ”",
