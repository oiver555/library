					<p>All these, in variously acting out the part which provoked the condemnation written against the Laodiceans, thereby fulfilling the prophecy which they ought not fulfill, are preparing themselves to be spued out (Rev. 3:14-18).

					<h4>PRE-"ELEVENTH HOUR" EXTRA! THE DARDANELLES OF THE BIBLE.</h4>
				</div>
			
			
				<div id="page-5.1" style="padding-top: 200pt; margin-top: -200pt;">
					<p> The call of Ezekiel to the prophetic office is one of the most interesting experiences of the ancient seers, and the revelation of what he saw by the river Chebar is perhaps of greater importance to heaven and earth at this time than is any other vision on sacred record, because in a remarkable way it reveals That Which unites Heaven with Earth, even as the Dardanelles links two important seas. Thus this study of Ezekiel's vision which brings to light earth's being visited by the Majesty of the Universe, may be aptly termed, "The Dardanelles of the Bible."<span class="pagination"> 1Tr 5.1</span></p>

				<div id="page-5.4" style="padding-top: 200pt; margin-top: -200pt;">
					<p> "Also out of the midst thereof came the likeness of four living creatures. And this was their appearance; ance they had the likeness of a man. And every one had four faces, and every one had four wings. And their feet were straight feet; and the sole of their feet was like the sole of a calf's foot: and they sparkled like the colour of burnished brass. And they had the hands of a man under their wings on their four sides; and they four had their faces and their wings.

					<p> "And I saw as the colour of amber, as the appearance of fire round about within it, from the appearance of his loins even upward, and from the appearance of his loins even downward, I saw as it were the appearance of fire, and it had brightness round about. As the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day of rain, so was the appearance of the brightness round about. This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the Lord And when I saw it, I fell upon my face, and I heard a voice of one that spake." Ezek. 1:4-10, 27, 28.<span class="pagination"> 1Tr 6.2</span></p>

				<div id="page-6.3" style="padding-top: 200pt; margin-top: -200pt;">

					<p> To this marvelous scene which Ezekiel saw on the river bank in the land of the Chaldeans, our undivided attention is now called. Being "the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the Lord," obviously, then, it was<span class="pagination"> 1Tr 7.1</span></p>

					<h4>The Lord on One of His Thrones.</h4>
				</div>
			
				<div id="page-7.3" style="padding-top: 200pt; margin-top: -200pt;">
					<p> Besides this divine appearance which Ezekiel saw (Ezek. 1:28), the Bible describes God enthroned on three other occasions -- once as seen by Isaiah, and twice as seen by John the Revelator; to wit:<span class="pagination"> 1Tr 7.3</span></p>
				</div>
			
				<div id="page-7.4" style="padding-top: 200pt; margin-top: -200pt;">
					<p> (1) "...I saw also the Lord sitting upon a throne high and lifted up, and His train filled the temple. Above it stood the seraphims: each one had six wings; with twain he covered his face, and with twain he covered his feet, and with twain he did fly. And one cried unto another, and said, Holy holy, holy, is the Lord of hosts: the whole earth is full of His glory. And the posts of the door moved at the voice of him that cried and the house was filled with smoke." Isa. 6:1-4.<span class="pagination"> 1Tr 7.4</span></p>
				</div>
			
				<div id="page-7.5" style="padding-top: 200pt; margin-top: -200pt;">
					<p> (2) "And immediately I was in the spirit: and behold, a throne was set in heaven, and one sat on the throne... And round about the throne were four and twenty seats: and upon the seats I saw four and twenty elders sitting, clothed in white raiment; and they had on their heads crowns of gold... and there were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne, which are the seven Spirits of God. And before the throne there was a sea of glass like unto crystal: and in the midst of the throne, and round about the throne, were four beasts full of eyes before and behind." Rev. 4:2, 4-6.<span class="pagination"> 1Tr 7.5</span></p>
				</div>
			
				<div id="page-8.1" style="padding-top: 200pt; margin-top: -200pt;">
					<p> (3) "And he shewed me a pure river of water of life, clear as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb." Rev. 22:1.<span class="pagination"> 1Tr 8.1</span></p>
				</div>
			
				<div id="page-8.2" style="padding-top: 200pt; margin-top: -200pt;">
					<p> Since the throne seen by Isaiah was a "train" (retinue), and since as it entered into the temple, "the posts of the door moved at the voice of him that cried, and the house was filled with smoke" (Isa. 6:1, 4), it therefore is a traveling throne, whereas both the one of Revelation 4, having the "sea of glass" before it, and the one of Revelation 22, having the "river...of life" before it, are stationary thrones.<span class="pagination"> 1Tr 8.2</span></p>
				</div>
			
				<div id="page-8.3 "style="padding-top: 200pt; margin-top: -200pt;">
					<p> Though the one which Ezekiel saw is similar to the one which Isaiah was shown, yet they are distinct and separate thrones, for each of the "seraphims" of Isaiah's vision has six wings, while each of the "cherubims" of Ezekiel's vision has but four. In the latter, moreover, the cherubims stood under the throne, whereas in the former, they stood above it. On record, therefore, are four thrones -- two stationary, and two traveling.<span class="pagination"> 1Tr 8.3</span></p>
				</div>
			
				<div id="page-9.1 "style="padding-top: 200pt; margin-top: -200pt;">
					<p> In determining the location of the throne of Revelation 4, and the one of Revelation 22, we note to begin with that the latter, the one from which the "river...of life" proceeds, is, says the Revelator, "the throne of God and of the Lamb" -- that upon which Christ sat at the right hand of God after His resurrection. The former, the one having the sea of glass before it, is (also according to John's view) in the most holy apartment of the heavenly sanctuary, for John saw before it "seven lamps of fire" (Rev. 4:5) -- a sanctuary fixture. "As in vision the apostle John was granted a view of the temple of God in heaven he beheld there 'seven lamps of fire burning before the throne.' " -- The Great Controversy, p. 414.<span class="pagination"> 1Tr 9.1</span></p>
				</div>
			
				<div id="page-9.2 "style="padding-top: 200pt; margin-top: -200pt;">
					<p> Then, concerning the Father and the Son's moving from the throne of God and of the Lamb -- the one where the river of life is -- to the throne where the sea of glass is, we read: "I saw the Father rise from the throne, and in a flaming chariot go into the holy of holies within the veil, and sit down. Then
						Jesus rose up from the throne,... Then a cloudy chariot, with wheels like flaming fire, surrounded by angels, came to where Jesus was. He stepped into the chariot and was borne to the holiest, where the Father sat." -- Early Writings, p. 55.<span class="pagination"> 1Tr 9.2</span></p>
				</div>
			
				<div id="page-9.3" style="padding-top: 200pt; margin-top: -200pt;">
					<p> Recording the same event as he saw it, Daniel says: "I beheld till the thrones were cast down and the Ancient of days did sit, Whose garment was white as snow, and the hair of His head like the pure wool: His throne was like the fiery flame, and His wheels as burning fire. A fiery stream issued and came forth from before Him: thousand thousands ministered unto Him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before Him: the judgment was set, and the books were opened." Dan. 7:9, 10.<span class="pagination"> 1Tr 9.3</span></p>
				</div>
			
				<div id="page-10.1" style="padding-top: 200pt; margin-top: -200pt;">
					<p> Our greatest interest, however, at this point, is to know the location and the mission of the throne which Ezekiel saw, and concerning which he says: "...I looked, and, behold, a whirlwind came out of the north." Ezek. 1:4. The fact that the "whirlwind," enveloping the throne, "came," says Ezekiel, shows that this throne, just as with the one of Isaiah 6, is a moving one, and that it came to the banks of the river Chebar.<span class="pagination"> 1Tr 10.1</span></p>
				</div>
			
				<div id="page-10.2" style="padding-top: 200pt; margin-top: -200pt;">
					<p> "This is the living creature," continues Ezekiel, "that I saw under the God of Israel [Who is "above the cherubims"], by the river of Chebar; and I knew that they were the cherubims." "And the cherubims lifted up their wings, and mounted up from the earth in my sight." Ezek. 10:20, 19.<span class="pagination"> 1Tr 10.2</span></p>
				</div>
			
				<div id="page-10.3" style="padding-top: 200pt; margin-top: -200pt;">
					<p> As the chariot's mounting "up from the earth" shows that in this particular throne, God visits the earth and then, when His mission is accomplished, returns to heaven, naturally our uppermost desire is to know the answer to the question,<span class="pagination"> 1Tr 10.3</span></p>
				</div>
			
				<div id="page-10.subHeading" class="center" style="padding-top: 200pt; margin-top: -200pt;">
					<h4>When Will This Prophetic Vision Be Fulfilled?</h4>
				</div>
			
				<div id="page-11.1" style="padding-top: 200pt; margin-top: -200pt;">
					<p> According to Ezekiel 2:3; 3:1, 4, 5, 7, the prophet was to bear his message to the whole "house of Israel" (the term "house of Israel," denoting either all twelve tribes or only the ten tribes as the case might be). Yet he did not understand the meaning of the vision. Had he he would have explained it, rather than declaring: "I came to them of the captivity at Telabib, that dwelt by the river of Chebar, and I sat where they sat, and remained there astonished among them seven days." Ezek. 3:15.<span class="pagination"> 1Tr 11.1</span></p>
				</div>
			
				<div id="page-11.2" style="padding-top: 200pt; margin-top: -200pt;">
					<p> Since at the time of the vision, the house of Judah, the two-tribe kingdom, was in captivity in the land of the Chaldeans, and the house of Israel, the ten-tribe kingdom, was in dispersion among the nations whither it had been carried away and scattered some years before (2 Kings 17:6), there was no possibility of Ezekiel's delivering the message to them. And as it is to both the house of Israel and the house of Judah (Ezek. 9:9), -- the twelve tribes, -- consequently it was prophetic in Ezekiel's time.<span class="pagination"> 1Tr 11.2</span></p>
				</div>
			
				<div id="page-11.3" style="padding-top: 200pt; margin-top: -200pt;">
					<p> The Jewish nation, moreover, up to the time of Christ, had no light on this prophecy, and it appeared to them as too complicated to understand, and even unsafe for an ordinary mind to read. "All this chapter appeared so obscure and full of mysteries, to the ancient Hebrews, that, as we learn from St. Jerome (Ep. ad Paulin.,) they suffered none to read it before they were thirty years old." Douay Version, footnote to Ezekiel 1:5. And having seen no light in this scripture until the present time, the Christian church has made little or no attempt to explain it.<span class="pagination"> 1Tr 11.3</span></p>
				</div>
			
				<div id="page-12.1" style="padding-top: 200pt; margin-top: -200pt;">
					<p> And finally as no slaughter such as the one described in Ezekiel 9 has ever occurred, its fulfillment is obviously yet future.<span class="pagination"> 1Tr 12.1</span></p>
				</div>
			
				<div id="page-12.2" style="padding-top: 200pt; margin-top: -200pt;">
					<p> Plainly, therefore, the vision was prophetic in Ezekiel's time, and has been prophetic ever since. And if it is ever to be fulfilled, and not remain a useless and unprofitable writing, -- a thing which God never creates, -- then its mystery must, of course, now be unveiled, and its action executed in the near future.<span class="pagination"> 1Tr 12.2</span></p>
				</div>
				<div id="page-12.3" style="padding-top: 200pt; margin-top: -200pt;">
					<p> In the clear light of these facts, chapter nine is seen to hold the climactic scene of the vision. Describing the awful work which the Lord is to do when, with the cherubim, He visits the earth, it shows the fearsome consequences to those who reject its message: its blessings missed, the kingdom lost! Tragic, frightful experience, it shall be the fate of all who refuse now to awake and to know about it, but who choose rather to remain in ignorance of its truth, and of</p>

					<h4>The Object of the Lord's Coming In His Throne.</h4>
				</div>
			
				<div id="page-12.4" style="padding-top: 200pt; margin-top: -200pt;">
					<p> As the prophet was looking toward the north, he saw a "great cloud" coming like a "whirlwind" to earth. Watching with intense interest its drawing nearer and nearer, finally he saw the "living creatures," the "wheels," and the rest, -- "the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the Lord." Whereupon, "I fell," he says, "upon my face, and I heard a voice of one that spake [unmistakably the Lord Himself come to give a message to Ezekiel].<span class="pagination"> 1Tr12.4</span></p>
				</div>
			
				<div id="page-13.1" style="padding-top: 200pt; margin-top: -200pt;">
					<p> "...And He said unto me, Son of man, I send thee to the children of Israel, to a rebellious nation that hath rebelled against Me: they and their fathers have transgressed against Me, even unto this very day. For they are impudent children and stiff-hearted. I do send thee unto them: and thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the Lord God. And they, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear, (for they are a rebellious house,) yet shall know that there hath been a prophet among them. And thou, son of man, be not afraid of them, neither be afraid of their words, though briars and thorns be with thee, and thou dost dwell among scorpions: be not afraid of their words, nor be dismayed at their looks, though they be a rebellious house." Ezek. 1:28; 2:3-6.<span class="pagination"> 1Tr 13.1</span></p>
				</div>
			
				<div id="page-13.2" style="padding-top: 200pt; margin-top: -200pt;">
					<p> "And He said unto me," continues the prophet, "Son of man, go, get thee unto the house of Israel, and speak with My words unto them. For thou art not sent to a people of a strange speech and of an hard language,...whose words thou canst not understand." Ezek. 3:4-6.<span class="pagination"> 1Tr 13.2</span></p>
				</div>
			
				<div id="page-14.1" style="padding-top: 200pt; margin-top: -200pt;">
					<p> These mandatory words (of weighty significance to all) reveal that the message which the prophet received is only for God's people, and that therefore, by logical extension, the entire vision, of which it is a part, meets its fulfillment at a time in which the Lord sends forth the warning that because His church is at a very low ebb spiritually, -- "impudent and hard-hearted" and "a rebellious house," -- He will do within it a work of marking and slaying. And in all the Bible there is to be found in but one church a situation as to condition, cause, time, and result answering to that of the prophecy, and that is in<span class="pagination"> 1Tr 14.1</span></p>

					<h4>The Laodicean Church.</h4>

				<div id="page-14.2" style="padding-top: 200pt; margin-top: -200pt;">
					<p> The condemnation of Rev. 3:14-18 against the Laodiceans, and the condemnation of Ezek. 2:1-7 and 3:4-7 against "the house of Israel," being the same, each therefore is the complement of the other: the one being the Revelation of that of which the other is the prophecy.<span class="pagination"> 1Tr 14.2</span></p>
				</div>
			
				<div id="page-14.3" style="padding-top: 200pt; margin-top: -200pt;">
					<p> Both vindicate the Spirit of Prophecy's warning that no "greater deception can come upon human minds than a confidence that they are right, when they are all wrong! The message of the True Witness finds the people of God in a sad deception [instead of in an excellent condition], yet honest in that deception. They know not that their condition is deplorable in the sight of God. While those addressed are flattering themselves that they are in an exalted spiritual condition, the message of the True Witness breaks their security by the tling denunciation of their true condition of spiritual blindness, poverty, and wretchedness. The testimony, so cutting and severe, cannot be a mistake, for it is the True Witness who speaks, and His testimony must be correct.

					<p> Were God's people to continue self-deceived, "impudent and hardhearted," and were the spirituality of the church to continue to dim away, then with such a church the Lord could never finish His work on earth, and probation must finally close upon a world in utter darkness, having no living saints to translate at the appearing of Christ.<span class="pagination"> 1Tr 15.2</span></p>

					<p> "...While the investigative judgment is going forward in heaven,...there is to be a special work of purification, of putting away of sin, among God's people upon earth.... Then the church which our Lord at His coming is to receive to Himself will be 'a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing.' Then she will look forth as the morning, fair as the moon, clear as the sun, and terrible as an army with banners.' " "Clad in the armor of Christ's righteousness, the church is to enter upon her final inflict....she is to go forth into all the world, conquering and to conquer." -- The Great Controversy, p. 425; Prophets and Kings, p. 725.<span class="pagination"> 1Tr 16.3</span></p>

					<p> Mark the italicized words: "not having spot," "her final conflict," "going forth into all the world, conquering and to conquer."

					<p> As these mighty works are done in the time of the "Loud Cry of the Third Angel's Message," the purification, therefore, incontrovertibly takes place at the commencement of the "Loud Cry." And from this it follows as a logical necessity that Ezekiel's prophecy of marking and slaying must contain the announcement of the purification of the church.<span class="pagination"> 1Tr 17.3</span></p>

					<p> Continuing to behold in vision the cherubim and the glory of God's throne, the prophet saw the Lord come to the threshold of the house (church), and as He gave charge to His angel who was "clothed with linen" and who "had the writer's inkhorn by his side," Ezekiel heard Him command the man: "Go through the midst of the city, through the midst of Jerusalem, and set a mark upon the foreheads of the men that sigh and that cry for all the abominations that be done in the midst thereof.<span class="pagination"> 1Tr 17.4</span></p>

					<p> Revealing a complete separation of the wicked from among the just, these verses, therefore, prophetically forewarn of the imminent purification of the church -- her only salvation.

					<p> The sealing (Rev. 7) being the same as the marking (Ezek. 9), -- the "purification,"-- we thus are given a twofold view of the "closing work for the church,...the sealing time of the one hundred and forty-four thousand who are to stand without fault before the throne of God.... They feel most deeply the wrongs of God's professed people. This is forcibly set forth by the prophet's illustration of the last work under the figure of the men each having a slaughter weapon in his hand. One man among them was clothed with linen, with a writer's inkhorn by his side." -- Testimonies, Vol. 3, p. 266.<span class="pagination"> 1Tr 19.5</span></p>

				<div id="page-20.1" style="padding-top: 200pt; margin-top: -200pt;">
					<p> Since the purification, or the sealing, came at the commencement of the "Loud Cry," as we have already seen, the 144,000 are therefore the "first-fruits" -- the first to be sealed; whereas those who are sealed after the purification of the church, are the second fruits, of whom John (after having seen the 144,000 sealed) says: "After this I beheld, and, lo, a great multitude which no man could number, of all nations, and kindreds, and people, and tongues, stood before the throne, and before the Lamb, clothed with white robes, and palms in their hands."

					<p>"And behold," says Ezekiel, "the man clothed with linen, which had the inkhorn by his side, reported the matter [while on earth] saying, I have done as Thou hast commanded me." Ezek. 9:11. Here is the first report, made at the completion of the sealing in the church -- the sealing of the firstfruits, the 144,000.<span class="pagination"> 1Tr 20.3</span></p>
				</div>
			
				<div id="page-21.1" style="padding-top: 200pt; margin-top: -200pt;">
					<p> "I saw," says the servant of the Lord, "...an angel with a writer's inkhorn by his side returned from the earth, and reported to Jesus that his work was done, and the saints were numbered and sealed." -- Early Writings, p. 279. Here is his second report, made at the completion of the sealing in the world -- the sealing of the second fruits, the great multitude.<span class="pagination"> 1Tr 21.1</span></p>
				</div>
			
				<div id="page-21.2" style="padding-top: 200pt; margin-top: -200pt;">
					<p>Comparing both reports, each is seen to be of a different event: At the first report, the Lord was on "the threshold of the house" on earth (Ezek. 9:3); at the second, He was in the heavenly sanctuary.<span class="pagination"> 1Tr 21.2</span></p>
				</div>
			
				<div id="page-21.3" style="padding-top: 200pt; margin-top: -200pt;">
					<p>After the angel had made his first report, the Lord commanded him: "Go in between the wheels, even under the cherub, and fill thine hand with coals of fire from between the cherubims, and scatter them over the city. And he went in my sight." Ezek. 10:2.<span class="pagination"> 1Tr 21.3</span></p>

				<div id="page-21.4" style="padding-top: 200pt; margin-top: -200pt;">
					<p>But following his second report, "...all the angelic host laid off their crowns as Jesus made the solemn declaration, 'He that is unjust, let him be unjust still; and he which is filthy, let him be filthy still; and he that is righteous, let him be righteous still: and he that is holy, let him be holy still.'

				<div id="page-22.1" style="padding-top: 200pt; margin-top: -200pt;">
					<p> Were probation to close at the time of the first report (Ezek. 9:11), the Lord must, according to the foregoing statement, be in heaven, then descend to earth to receive His saints, instead of being already on earth, then mounting up in His throne, as He actually does, without His saints (Ezek. 10:19).<span class="pagination"> 1Tr 22.1</span></p>

				<div id="page-22.2" style="padding-top: 200pt; margin-top: -200pt;">
					<p> Again: the prophet's being left behind when the Lord went up, figuratively shows that at this particular descent and ascent, the saints are not to be taken to heaven, but only to be set free from sin and sinners -- fitted for the final work.<span class="pagination"> 1Tr 22.2</span></p>
				</div>
			
				<div id="page-22.3" style="padding-top: 200pt; margin-top: -200pt;">

					<p> "For by fire and by His sword," declares the gospel prophet, "will the Lord plead with all flesh: and the slain of the Lord shall be many.... And I will send those that escape of them unto the nations,...to the isles afar off, that have not heard My fame, neither have seen My glory; and they shall declare My glory among the Gentiles.

					<p> Since "those that escape" the slaughter (the 144,000) shall "bring all your brethren [all those who shall be saved in the time of the 'Loud Cry']...into the house of the Lord," then it follows that those who escape are the ones who finish the work -- the reason they are called "the servants of God."

They will feed upon the errors and mistakes and faults of others, 'until,' said the angel, 'the Lord Jesus shall rise up from his mediatorial work in the heavenly sanctuary, and shall clothe himself with the garments of vengeance, and surprise them at their unholy feast; and they will find themselves unprepared for the marriage supper of the Lamb.'

					<p> These solemn words, may each lay well to heart, and may none let the enemy beguile them "with good words and fair speeches" on this life-and-death matter.

					<p> Ezekiel's prophecy revealing itself to be a message for the church today, the prophet, himself, must necessarily, then, represent the messengers who carry the message to the church at the time appointed. And in response to the Lord's command, "Be not thou rebellious like that rebellious house: open thy mouth, and eat that I give thee," Ezekiel's reply, "Then did I eat it; and it was in my mouth as honey for sweetness" (Ezek. 2:8; 3:3), shows that the messengers obey the Lord and love His Word above everything else.<span class="pagination"> 1Tr 27.3</span></p>

					<p> The reader will note that, though the prophet was bidden to go speak to his people, yet instead of being told what to say, he was commanded: "Open thy mouth, and eat that I give thee. And when I looked," says Ezekiel, "behold, an hand was sent unto me; and, lo, a roll of a book was therein.... Moreover he said unto me Son of man, eat that thou findest; eat this roll and go speak unto the house of Israel. So I opened my mouth, and he caused me to eat that roll."

					<p> "And, lo, a roll of a book was therein; and he spread it before me; and it was written within and without: and there was written therein lamentations, and mourning, and woe" (Ezek. 2:9, 10) -- dire writ envisaging the slaughter in Ezekiel 9, and the woes pronounced in the Master's parables: "The Lord of that servant shall come in a day when he looketh not for Him, and in an hour that he is not aware of. And shall cut him asunder, and appoint him his portion with the hypocrites: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth." "Then said the king to the servants, Bind him hand and foot, and take him away, and cast him into outer darkness; there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth."

					<p> And aforetime through His servant Moses, He declared unto His people: "It shall come to pass, if thou wilt not hearken unto the voice of the Lord thy God, to observe to do all His commandments and His statutes which I command thee this day; that all these curses shall come upon thee, and overtake thee." Deut. 28:15. "I call heaven and earth to record this day against you, that I have set before you life and death, blessing and cursing: therefore choose life, that both thou and thy seed may live."

					<p> The "book" which Ezekiel ate being "written within and without" (Ezek. 2:10), the writing "within," therefore, can only be the prophetic Word of God, proclaiming the curses and the blessings that are written in the Bible; while the writing "without," can be nothing else but the sure record of the fulfillment of that within -- the record, in short, of the prophecy's becoming history; showing thereby that God has spoken it and wiil perform it.<span class="pagination"> 1Tr 31.1</span></p>

					<p> Glancing at the cover-page objectification the reader will note that "two wings of every one" of the living creatures "were joined one to another." Ezek. 1:11. Both they and the wheels therefore, each formed a square: "one wheel by one cherub, and another wheel by another cherub." Ezek. 10:9.<span class="pagination"> 1Tr 33.1</span></p>

				<div id="page-33.2" style="padding-top: 200pt; margin-top: -200pt;">

He saw the living wheels moreover, so arranged that "they went upon their four sides." Ezek. 1:17. (See cover-page.)<span class="pagination"> 1Tr 33.2</span></p>

				<div id="page-33.3" style="padding-top: 200pt; margin-top: -200pt;">
					<p> The four-way vision of the living creatures along with the four-way movement of the wheels, enables four-directional motion -- forward or backward, to the right or to the left: the living creatures "turned not as they went." Ezek. 10:11.<span class="pagination"> 1Tr 33.3</span></p>

					<p> "And their feet" being "straight feet" (Ezek. 1:7), it enabled them to move freely in any direction without turning, so that they "ran and returned as the appearance of a flash of lightning" (Ezek. 1:14).

					<p> As these wheels, making a square formation "ran and returned," and as "over them above," God was sitting on His throne, it is evident that this marvelous living mechanism is the vehicle of God -- His chariot in which He has come to bring the message to separate the "wicked from among the just."

				<div id="page-35.3" style="padding-top: 200pt; margin-top: -200pt;">
					<p> The faces of the cherubim being the same as those of the beasts of the Revelation, they both necessarily have complementary significance the key to which John supplies: "And they sung a new song, saying, Thou art worthy to take the book, and to open the seals thereof: for thou wast slain, and hast redeemed us to God by Thy blood out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation."

					<p>The very fact that these beasts have been redeemed by the blood of Christ and shall reign upon earth, shows that they are symbolical of the saints, even as the beasts of Daniel are symbolical of the nations.

					<h4>When Will This Chariot Arrive? How Long Will It Stay?</h4>
				</div>
			
				<div id="page-36.5" style="padding-top: 200pt; margin-top: -200pt;">
					<p> When considered in the light of the four main facts so far established, these questions are virtually self-answering: (1) the Lord comes to earth in this chariot; (2) from it He commands Ezekiel to go speak to His people; (3) Ezekiel did not bear the message to the people of his day; (4) he will bear it to the people at the commencement of the "Loud Cry."<span class="pagination"> 1Tr 36.5</span></p>
				</div>
			
				<div id="page-37.1" style="padding-top: 200pt; margin-top: -200pt;">
					<p> Thus it is seen that when the time comes that the church has reached the condition described by the Lord (Ezek. 3-9), the mystery of the vision is to be revealed, and the message carried to the church. And that the church has already reached this time and condition is conclusively evidenced by the threefold fact that the first part of this "most startling revelation" (dilated herein), was published in December, 1930, in a 255-page book entitled The Shepherd's Rod Vol. 1; that the second part was published in the month of September, 1932, in a 304-page book entitled The Shepherd's Rod, Vol. 2; and that the third part -- the series of tracts (of which this is the first) which since 1933 aggregates to date some 898 pages -- comprises Volume 3.<span class="pagination"> 1Tr 37.1</span></p>

				<div id="page-37.2" style="padding-top: 200pt; margin-top: -200pt;">
					<p> The fact, therefore, that from the chariot, the Lord commands the prophet to go speak, bear the message, to His people, and that the message totals over 1250 pages of literature published since 1930, unfolding its truth from different angles, solemnly reveals that the chariot, though invisible to human beings (as to "the young man" were the chariots which covered the mountains -- 2 Kings 6:17), has already arrived.<span class="pagination"> 1Tr 37.2</span></p>

					<p>And since it is already here, it must of course be the divine instrumentality through which, as a sort of base of operations, the Lord is ordering and directing His work, and through which He shall do so until "this gospel of the kingdom...be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and...the end come." Matt. 24:14. "The end" -- the unbelievable! to those who say "Where is the promise of His coming? for since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation" (2 Pet. 3:4); but the long-looked-for, to those who shall say, "Lo, this is our God; we have waited for Him and He will save us" (Isa. 25:9). -- Dreadful awful, finality! it should drive all to ascertain<span class="pagination"> 1Tr 38.1</span></p>

				<div id="page-38.2" style="padding-top: 200pt; margin-top: -200pt;">
					<p> "And it came to pass, while they were slaying them, and I was left, that I fell upon my face, and cried, and said, Ah Lord God! wilt Thou destroy all the residue of Israel in Thy pouring out of Thy fury upon Jerusalem? Then said He unto me, The iniquity of the house of Israel and Judah is exceeding great,...and as for Me also, Mine eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity." Ezek. 9:8-10.<span class="pagination"> 1Tr 38.2</span></p>
				</div>
			
				<div id="page-38.3" style="padding-top: 200pt; margin-top: -200pt;">
					<p> After the sighing and crying ones were marked (which is not to be understood as being consummated in its entirety worldwide before the slaying follows anywhere), the slaughter completed, and the matter reported, the Lord "spake unto the man clothed with linen, and said, Go in between the wheels even under the cherub, and fill thine hand with coals of fire from between the cherubims, and scatter them over the city." Ezek. 10:2.<span class="pagination"> 1Tr 38.3</span></p>
				</div>
			
				<div id="page-39.1" style="padding-top: 200pt; margin-top: -200pt;">
					<p> The scattering of the "coals of fire...over the city" represents absolute purification of the heart (Gospel Workers, p. 23) effected by the outpouring of the Holy Spirit upon those who receive the "mark" -- those who escape the "slaughter. "<span class="pagination"> 1Tr 39.1</span></p>
				</div>
			
				<div id="page-39.2" style="padding-top: 200pt; margin-top: -200pt;">
					<p> Following the completion of the "slaughter," and just preceding the scattering of the "coals of fire over the city," "the cherubims stood on the right side of the house,...and the cloud filled the inner court." Ezek. 10:2, 3. Later they "lifted up their wings, and mounted up from the earth in my sight," says the prophet. Ezek. 10:19. Then subsequently he saw them again "lift up their wings" (Ezek. 11:22, 23), showing that though they had departed after the separation took place (Ezek. 10:3, 19), they had later returned, and were now departing for the second time.<span class="pagination"> 1Tr 39.2</span></p>
				</div>
			
				<div id="page-39.3" style="padding-top: 200pt; margin-top: -200pt;">
					<p> With the city thus purged of sin and sinners, and none but the "residue," the righteous, remaining, "I, saith the Lord, will be unto her a wall of fire round about, and will be the glory in the midst of her.... Sing and rejoice, O daughter of Zion: for, lo, I come, and I will dwell in the midst of thee, saith the Lord. And many nations shall be joined to the Lord in that day, and shall be My people: and I will dwell in the midst of thee, and thou shalt know that the Lord of hosts hath sent me unto thee." Zech. 2:5, 10, 11. (For a more ample explanation of these verses, see The Shepherd's Rod, Vol. 2, pp. 259-282.)<span class="pagination"> 1Tr 39.3</span></p>

				<div id="page-40.1" style="padding-top: 200pt; margin-top: -200pt;">
					<p> Mark that while He dwells in the midst of His people, "many nations shall be joined to the Lord in that day," and that He will be unto them "a wall of fire round about." Here we are graphically reassured that "in that day," in the day that the Lord takes the reins in His Own hands and comes to dwell in the midst of the city, His Presence, His marvelous chariot, shall be a protection round about His people!<span class="pagination"> 1Tr 40.1</span></p>

				<div id="page-40.2" style="padding-top: 200pt; margin-top: -200pt;">
					<p> Thus it is seen that the Lord has come to purify His people by putting away the wicked from among them, "take charge" of His clean flock, and with them finish His work. In this we see that the church has come to her crisis. She that travaileth "must give birth." And "as soon as Zion travailed, she brought forth her children." Isa. 66:8.<span class="pagination"> 1Tr 40.2</span></p>

				<div id="page-40.3" style="padding-top: 200pt; margin-top: -200pt;">
					<p> Then shall the chariot, being dedicated to the saints, and filled to capacity, take off for the portals of glory -- "the land that is very far off." "...and as the chariot rolled upward, the wheels cried, 'Holy,' and the wings, as they moved, cried, 'holy,' and the retinue of holy angels around the cloud cried, 'Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty!' And the saints in the cloud cried, 'Glory! Alleluia!' And the chariot rolled upward to the holy city." -- Early Writings, pp. 287, 288.<span class="pagination"> 1Tr 40.3</span></p>

				<div id="page-41.2" style="padding-top: 200pt; margin-top: -200pt;">
					<p> Since Ezekiel represents those whose hearts the message has reached, then to them the Lord is speaking when He says: "Son of man, I have made thee a watchman unto the house of Israel: therefore hear the word at My mouth, and give them warning from Me. When I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die; and thou givest him not warning, nor speakest to warn the wicked from his wicked way, to save his life; the same wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at thine hand. Yet if thou warn the wicked, and he turn not from his wickedness, nor from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul.<span class="pagination"> 1Tr 41.2</span></p>
				</div>
			
				<div id="page-41.3" style="padding-top: 200pt; margin-top: -200pt;">
					<p> "Again, When a righteous man doth turn from his righteousness, and commit iniquity, and I lay a stumbling block before him, he shall die: because thou hast not given him warning, he shall die in his sin, and his righteousness which he hath done shall not be remembered; but his blood will I require at thine hand. Nevertheless if thou warn the righteous man, that the righteous sin not, and he doth not sin, he shall surely live, because he is warned; also thou hast delivered thy soul." Ezek. 3 :17-21.<span class="pagination"> 1Tr 41.3</span></p>

				<div id="page-42.1" style="padding-top: 200pt; margin-top: -200pt;">
					<p> Because of the unfaithfulness of the former watchmen, the Lord makes the antitypical Ezekiel -- he and she who "sigh and cry for the abominations that be done in the midst thereof" (the church) -- a "watchman" (Ezek. 3:17) in their stead. Be careful, therefore, Brother, Sister, lest you also betray your trust and find yourself thrust out. "Wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall." 1 Cor. 10:12.

					<p> As you will find yourself under severe trial if you obey your inner convictions and take hold of the truth, you must therefore let the Lord alone be your guide, and Inspiration your only teacher. Do not value your salvation so little as to trust to the wisdom of another. Be wise: obey the word of the Lord, investigate for yourself, and do not delay, for you know not the narrow margin of time between you and heaven!

					<p> This fatal mistake was repeated during the Reformation, also in the preaching of the First, Second, and Third Angels' messages. Thus each one who accepted the advancing truth and became a member of the Seventh-day Adventist denomination, did so only by making his own investigation and decision independently of priest or scribe or pharisee. And if that method of investigation was the only sane and safe one then, it is just as certainly so now when we understand God's Word better than when we first believed! And though for your following obediently in the way God commands, the unfaithful watchmen of today "cast you out," and remove your name from the church books, you should rejoice (Isa. 66:5, Luke 6:22 23), and gladly endure the trial of your faith knowing that it "worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory" (2 Cor. 4:17); that, indeed, your accepting the truth and obeying it is the only thing that will forever insure your membership with the redeemed, in the church eternal, and that the only book that is worth-while having your name in is "The Lamb's Book of Life."<span class="pagination"> 1Tr 45.2</span></p>
